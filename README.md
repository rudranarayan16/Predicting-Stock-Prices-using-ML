# Predicting-Stock-Prices-using-ML

This project predicts stock market prices by applying machine learning techniques to historical data. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering (technical indicators, normalization), and model training using Linear Regression, Decision Trees/Random Forests, and Neural Networks. The models are evaluated with MAE, MSE, and RÂ², and results are visualized through actual vs. predicted price plots, providing insights into market trends and prediction accuracy.
